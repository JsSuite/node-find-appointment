# NodeJS Find Appointment 🍏
This is a technical practice to write a function to find appointment

### About ℹ️

 - All times in the calendars will be given in 24h format "hh:mm", the result must also be in that format
 - A meeting is represented by its start time (inclusively) and end time (exclusively) -> if a meeting takes
place from 09:00 - 11:00, the next possible start time would be 11:00
 - The businessmen work from 09:00 (inclusively) - 19:00 (exclusively), the appointment must start and end within that range
 - If the meeting does not fit into the schedules, return null
 - The duration of the meeting will be provided as an integer in minutes
